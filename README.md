# DevTo

This dev_to gem will scrape the blogging website, dev.to, and update the user with the top 20 hashtags of blog topics. The user will select the number of the topic hashtag that they want to see recent blogposts for. The gem will then show most recent 8 articles that have tagged that topic in their post. It will also give the URL of the blogpost, so if the user is interested, they will be able to read the entire post online.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dev_to'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dev_to
